		  <p>Day 1:</p>
		  <p>This course discusses a built in datatype in Pyhton called a list.
		  A list is a powerful data structure that allows you to group
		  multiple values together in a single container.</p>
		  <p>We are going to learn how to create, combine, manipulate and use
		  lists to our advantage. At the end of this tutorial, we will build an 
		  interactive console application that will prompt the user to 
		  build a grocery list.</p>

		<h1>Creation: </h1>
			<p>Day 2:</p>
			<p>We can create a string by placing some characters in quotes,
			this is known as a string literal, There is also something known
			as a list literal. It is created by surrounding your string in
			hard brackets also referred to as square brackets.</p>
			<p>You can put your strings inside of these square brackets 
			and seperate them with commas. You create a new list in the REPL 
			by typing [], which creates a brand new empty list.
			</p>
			<p>You can add to an empty list by typing your objects sepereated 
			by commas, making it into a list object. In order to store a list to 
			keep it around for later use, assign it a variable with an appropriate
			name. Example ( languages = ['Python', 'JavaScript' 'C#'] )
			</p>

		  <p>Now that we have a list we can check and see how many items it has 
		  by using the len() function, the same way we use it to find the letters in a string.
		  In this case...len(languages) ... will return the value of 3.
		  </p>
		  <p>There is saying in Python that goes "There should be ONE, and preferably
		  ONLY one, way to do it." This falls into the Zen of Python,
		  and Therefore, it can be said that the use of the len() function is PYTHONIC.
		  Now let's take a look at Coersion!</p>

				<p>Coersion:</p>	
				<p>Strings are immutable, meaning, they cannot be changed.</p>
				<p>...any non empty string, when coersed to a boolean is "Truthy",
				well, the same holds true for lists. If we use the bool() function
				on an empty list, it is false, just like an empty string...Emptiness is "Falsey".</p>
				<p>If you coerse a string into a list it makes each letter into an 
				iterable, maening each letter is able to be iterated over. For Example:
				coersion would become "c", "o", "e", "r", "s", "i", "o", "n".</p>

				<p>Multi-Demensional Lists:</p>
				<p>Multi-dimensional lists in Python. Lists are a very widely use data 
					structure in python. They contain a list of elements separated
					by comma. But sometimes lists can also contain lists within them.
					These are called nested lists or multidimensional lists.</p>
